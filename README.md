 * Make all players start the race in the same position
 * Make all vehicles (except your own) invisible for a few seconds after race start
 * Allow local custom games without needing extra players (boost/battle single races!)
 * Change the speed/boost/acceleration/handling stats for each character
 * Works in offline mode and custom games
 * Fully configurable by editing `settings.xml`. Changes are applied automatically the moment you save the file.
